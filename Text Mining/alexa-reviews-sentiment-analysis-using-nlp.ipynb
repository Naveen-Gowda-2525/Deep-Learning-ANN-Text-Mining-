       "\"Incredible piece of technology.I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.\""
